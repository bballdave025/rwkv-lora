##  Paste these to the beginning of any files that are the result of
##+   `conda env export` 
##+ or of any that are used to reproduce a conda
##+ environment.
##+ For me, that means 'environment.yml',
##+ 'environment_everything-i-installed.yml', and
##+ 'full_environment.yml'.
##
##  Whenever `conda env export` is run to show updates, these info
##+ blurbs won't automatically come up, so you should come get one
##+ or the other and paste it in.
